        I spend a lot of my time on the Internet, loosely configured. For better
        or for worse, I find myself circulating around the same websites,
        looking at the same kinds of photos and memes and blocks of text, and
        then I spend the rest of my time not at my computer - stretching,
        drinking, talking, running, getting the bus, cleaning, cooking -
        wondering if I spend too much time on the Internet. I’ve been thinking a
        lot about luck and randomness online too, particularly in relation to
        the world ‘offline’. In 1969, the artist John Giorno created a telephone
        line called Dial-A-Poem, where you could call a number and have someone
        recite a poem back to you. (it’s been decommissioned, and calling will
        take you to a nail salon in New York, who are probably really annoyed)
        <br /><br />
        I like the idea of calling a number with some idea of what comes out of
        the other end, even if it might not be something you’ve been exposed to
        before, and I like the idea of doing something with the intention of
        connection, even if you don’t know what awaits on the other side. Jason
        Polan, an artist I loved very much, passed away recently - he was on a
        mission to draw every person in New York, (<a
          href="http://everypersoninnewyork.blogspot.com/"
          >http://everypersoninnewyork.blogspot.com/</a
        >) and drew every painting at MoMa twice. What I love about his work –
        and the spirit he engendered - is that it was unfailingly sincere. In
        the interests of sincerity, here are links to articles, videos, essays,
        podcasts and websites that I, and people I know, have been turning over.
        None of it is my own work, although some of it is my friend’s. I also
        collected field recordings – from people I know very well to people I’ve
        never met before – and Ana + Mackenzie (the two coders / curators who
        have brought my sad, scrawled notes to life) placed them around the
        cityscape, so you never know what you might be biting into. Please
        enjoy! <br /><br />

        <b>Notes</b>
        <br /><br />
        One - the links and audio recordings aren’t labelled deliberately. But
        anything that’s potentially triggering has been labelled, and if you
        find that something is missing a warning, let me know at
        <a href="mailto: sanjanamvarghese@gmail.com"
          >sanjanamvarghese@gmail.com</a
        >
        and we can try and fix it! <br /><br />
        Two - please enjoy!
