                        <p class="about4">
                            23/06 — 23/08, 2018
                            <br><br>
                            <i>(+dis-)embodiment</i> is an exhibition by techno-feminist collaboration Proxy Mund that play with ideas of hegemony, self-optimisation and work culture. The duo present over 70 images of 3D scanned hands which pop up in a sequence of random loops, each picture dotted across the screen in varying sizes and orders with every refresh. This is the first show by External Pages, an online exhibition space that focuses to develop a new wave of net art relating to post-capitalist and xenofeminist thought.
                            <br><br>
                            Often applied as a reference to agency and free will, the representation of hands in this exhibition instead looks at how they are vehicles of compulsory production, and function as elements that define labour in both productive and reproductive (such as self-optimising) work. With the idea of physicality wanting to achieve “non-physicality” — fingers working to create virtual content or bodies enhancing to attain happiness — Poxy Mund explore the possibility of defining our anatomies beyond biological borders.
                            <br>
                            Using 2D screenshots of 3D scans, the pictured arms have a deceivingly interactive aesthetic to them and an audio track automatically plays on loop in the background, teasing the viewer with negligible command over what is happening on the webpage. <i>(+dis-)embodiment</i> applies this lack of power for the user to further question the agency involved in self-reinvention and the consequences of our online identities.
                            <br>
                            While Proxy Mund’s hands are here viewed as connectors between identity and its surrounding environment, we are introduced to "the lie of disembodied cyberspace" (C. Kraus, I Love Dick, 1997) and how the tangible and intangible operate as non-binary units.
                            <br><br>
                            Proxy Mund is an art project made up of <a href="http://www.eleniodysseos.net" target="_blank"> <u>Eleni Odysseos</u></a> and <a href="http://www.sofianovikoffunger.com" target="_blank"> <u>Sofia Albina Novikoff Unger</u></a>. They examine the connections between technology and the body, reflecting on economic, ecological and feminist discourses. Their medium is a combination of text, sound art, video, 3D modelling & scanning, motion capture, and sculptural objects. Based in London and founded at the Goldsmiths MFA Fine Art course, they are from Russian, Danish and Cypriot backgrounds.

                        <h4>ACQUA VRZAL</h4>
                        <p class="about4">
                            23/08 — 29/10, 2018
                            <br><br>
                            In a translucid internet experience, <u><a target="_blank" href="https://perlaovale.tumblr.com/">Acqua Vrzal</a></u> presents us with <i>?/§nake/girl/?</i>, the second show by online exhibition space, External Pages.
                            <br><br>
                            Currently transitioning from visual to movement, dance and performance art in Berlin, Vrzal’s practice has largely consisted of anonymous admin work, graphic design, and self-portraiture that she “mutilated” by editing and collaging, published under multiple aliases.
                            <br><br>
                            This is explored further in the disfigurement of computer graphics or online photography in our first solo show with the interdisciplinary artist. Vrzal introduces us to six main digitally-manipulated pictures that have either been stockpiled from google images or shot through her webcam. They float around our browser in multilayered arrangements and twisted, gelatinous pulsations while little visual assemblages of moths or winged “fairies” are randomly scattered, hovering between the self-portraits like spirit animals. Normal maps are stretched and used as background sets or core elements of a composition while reptiles, aliens and insects append to her photographed skin. References of eggs crop up in a variety of symbols, poems, urls and selfies, which oppose the incessant question of “girl or boy” with “girl or snake”.
                            <br><br>
                            While the page is laid out in ways that reminds us of a tumblr blog code that’s been fucked with, the topic of the show rests on how the artist copes with dysphoria, accumulated from her “tumblr trans teenager times”. Mixing liquify filters and magic wand selection tools in Photoshop with glitches and lags in CSS animation filters, <i>?/§nake/girl/?</i> marries gentle fluid movements with distortion, and asks us what alternatives can be found in exploring the self via grainy DIY imagery and fantasy narratives.

                            30/10 — 17/03, 2019

                            Fully committing to gush out her browser content in <i>Overshare</i>, <u><a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/view/georginatyson/home?authuser=0">Georgina Tyson</a></u> collaborates with External Pages to produce it's third exhibition of the year.
                            <br><br>
                            Between the 12th and 18th of June, 2018, Tyson shares the entirety of her online activity with us, that for some would seem too personal, to examine how we give out information that nobody asks for. Her internet history is completely disclosed and used as a structural basis for her video <i>Overshare</i>, which has been recreated as a website experience for External Pages. The virtual timeline demands to be scrolled through as short, private notes appear along the list of visited URLs, which vary from social media and online shopping services to sex work websites. Vines located next to these intimate logs automatically play only when visible, like reaction gifs on twitter, and alleviate her confidential entries from the contextual soreness of topics that cover emotional insecurity, mental health, and sex addiction.
                            <br><br>
                            The low-cost/brow/res multimedia artist showcased <i>Overshare</i> during September 7th — 13th at Chelsea College of Art, London, September 22nd at The Royal Standard as part of “Bye Hun!” for the School of the Damned handover show, and October 25th at Hotel Elephant as part of Micro Acts 4.
                            <br><br>
                            Georgina Tyson focuses on sex work, social class and the internet, and runs <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/low_res_camera_roll/?hl=en">low_res_camera_roll</a>, an instagram residency account. She is currently looking at the fetishisation of food and working class culture via personal experiences in the sex industry and art academia.

                            18/03 — 31/05, 2019
                            <br><br>
                            External Pages presents its fourth exhibition titled <i>a memory</i>, built by Toronto-based artist and designer <u><a target="_blank" href="http://www.mackenzie.blue/">Mackenzie Davidson</a></u>.
                            <br><br>
                            Embedded in the centre of Davidson's web-page, a round-edged frame displays a poem which loses parts of itself every time the page is loaded. With each successive visit to this website, the poem renders a newly fragmented text, and the previous text is deleted permanently. This process repeats until the full poem is completely erased, predisposing a blankness that is collectively produced by site visits of past internet users. By viewing the poem, the visitor automatically agrees to participate in destroying it.
                            <br><br>
                            As a co-founder of the design and technology studio 4 us and 4 others (past: <a target="_blank" href="https://56.digital/">56</a>, Temporary Studio), Davidson continues to think about the impermanent connections between people and art — especially in digital contexts — and how that may reflect in personal relationships in general. Their multidisciplinary coding practice retains writing as a foundational medium, having published their first poem in <i>damp</i> (<a target="_blank" href="https://mwvd.github.io/damp/">archive</a>), a group web project that requires user interaction and object orientation to unveil texts. Davidson’s past work has been exhibited at Ambiguous Ardour, Furthermore, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.centerfold.gallery/">Centerfold</a> Gallery, where they later became a creative director and partner.

                            <br><br>UPDATE: <i>a memory</i>'s poem is now entirely deleted due to a sufficient amount of site visits.

                        <h4>ANNA TOKAREVA</h4>
                        <p class="about4">
                            For its fifth exhibition External Pages collaborates with digital artist and designer <u><a target="_blank" href="http://annatokareva.net/">Anna Tokareva</a></u> to display <i>BYMG™</i>, a fictional pharmaceutical company website.
                            <br><br>
                            Fade and slide animations, habitually implemented in commercial websites to reveal dramatic background images and marketing slideshows, are instead employed to unveil Tokareva’s graphics in <i>BYMG™</i>. Molecular diagrams, schematic cell structures and labeled bin-genome networks are mutated and modified, displaying colourful hyperreal imitations of technical drawings. Various illustrations appear and vanish on random mouse hover commands, while others ease in and out of the window.
                            <br><br>
                            Baba Yaga Myco Glitch uses aesthetic means and promotional tactics from biotech companies that seek to enhance their online presence, to question their effect in producing vague company ethea and cryptic narratives. By adapting a specific set of UI and UX methods to increase website visibility, <i>BYMG™</i> explores how such SEO processes encourage a fabrication of ambiguous tales around medical research institutions. Tokareva has executed this through designing BYMG’s website as a front for the ulterior motives of the antagonistic Baba Yaga, a character often described in Slavic folklore as a villainous witch with equivocal intentions.
                            <br><br>
                            While this project aims to expose such storytelling procedures found in SEO management, Tokareva has faith in <i>BYMG™</i>. Baba Yaga’s intentions are routed in miscellaneous alchemic experimentation with chemical reactions, generative codes and homespun agency. The lab’s secret objectives lie in spreading their wild yeasts and self-growing cultures to infect its users with hallucinogenic visions of alternative futures.
                            <br><br>
                            Currently based in London and working in digital project management, Anna Tokareva (Rostov-na-Donu, 1988) explores entanglements between technoscience and contemporary mythologies, at micro and planetary scales. Her work has been exhibited in Auckland, Edinburgh and Madrid. Her essay “Nooscope: The Political Myth of Planetary Scale Computation” was recently published by the Digital Cultures Institute in New Zealand.
                            <br><br>
                            This exhibition will run until July 31st.

                            External Pages is an exhibition space that only exists online. Every other month, we showcase an artist or collective who push the potential of viewing art on our browsers, which we code ourselves in collaboration with the exhibitors. External Pages subsists on the outskirts of the Internet, where bottom up approaches to public space and access to art can be explored.

                            <p>This is an online exhibition space that focuses to develop a new wave of net art influenced by anti-capitalist and <a class="references" target="_blank" href="http://www.laboriacuboniks.net/qx8bq.txt">xenofeminist</a> thought. Founded in 2017 by Ana Meisel, External Pages experiments with web coding to question the placement of internet art in galleries, cheat curatorial hierarchies and look at how websites can be appropriated as an emancipatory technology. Although the internet’s current state seems exhaustive and impenetrable, “<a class="references" target="_blank" href="https://libcom.org/files/[Mark_Fisher]_Capitalist_Realism_Is_There_no_Alte(BookZZ.org).pdf">from a situation in which nothing can happen, suddenly anything is possible again</a>”.<br>
                            While using the conceptual breadths of art practice to subvert web-based functionalities, this organisation codes all the content for the artists, who have full control over how the show is curated.<br>
                            External Pages is editable, downloadable, open source/access and <a class="references" target="_blank" href="http://beingres.org/2017/06/30/afterthefuture-helenhester/">post-cyberfeminist</a>.</p>
