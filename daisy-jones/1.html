        Baldwin criticised Sidney Poitier in the film Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967) for portraying a character
        created to make white liberal audiences feel safe.<br /><br />
        The full quote reads “Guess Who's Coming to Dinner may prove in some bizarre way to be a milestone because it is
        really quite impossible to go any further in that particular direction. The next time the kissing will have to
        start.”
