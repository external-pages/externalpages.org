                        Exploring Liminality in the Virtual Sphere During the Interregnum Through Alice Morey and Emily Mulenga’s

                        ><br />
                        The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, its variants and quarantines have forced us to remain physically and culturally stuck in place in our
                        current condition, “a risky interregnum – a global subsidence at the end of western hegemony.”<sup>1</sup> Although the interregnum
                        started decades before the authoritarian, patriarchal Trump presidency and its meltdown, American citizens’ loss of confidence in its
                        government coupled with the pandemic further emphasized that America had lost its status as a guiding force. Progress as we knew it “has
                        been blown off course.” <sup>2</sup> Moreover, as the internet and its technologies have become increasingly important during our
                        hermetic existence, a closer look into the virtual sphere reveals that cultural time is increasingly grinding to a halt. Digital
                        capitalism has hyper- saturated the internet with an inescapable loop of imagery and sounds stuck on repeat while the artworld is being
                        flooded with art shaped by the “data religion” in which “algorithms that produce copies of themselves” are stripping humans of any need
                        to “find meaning within ourselves.” <sup>3</sup> Reminiscent of previous interregnums, our new normal is riddled with precarity,
                        disenchantment and an anxious stillness devoid of unique generational markers. Without any obvious replacement for guidance on progress,
                        where do we begin to look for inspiration?<br /><br />

                        Emerging artists, Alice Morey and Emily Mulenga are two Contemporary Artists that inject the virtual sphere with their virtual
                        exhibition, <i>Data_Blood III</i> to encourage dreaming and imagining of progress. Their online exhibition challenges the notion that
                        the virtual sphere is a site where art and artists are being lost to data-driven neoliberal economies who will ultimately produce “human
                        cogs...who can hardly pay attention, dream or doubt.” <sup>4</sup> Whereas previous iterations of Data_Blood consisted of in-real-life
                        immersive installations centered on transhumanism, Morey and Mulenga’s visual language began to shift early in 2021. Much of the virtual
                        exhibition was created in the wake of the COVID pandemic, the #metoo movement, Black Lives Matters protests and uprisings against
                        authoritarian governments worldwide. As they grappled with the hopes and promises of the movements and the worldwide humanitarian
                        crises, it is fitting that <i>Data_Blood III</i> move away from three-dimensional representations of the organic era and evolve into the
                        era of the machine and data.<br /><br />

                        In <i>Data_Blood III</i> the visitor finds a grey hued virtual room, in which the neutral grey tone of liminality eliminates dichotomous
                        black/white, man/woman, right/wrong ways of thinking and offers an indeterminate, in-between space of liminality. In this liminal space
                        which is ‘a rendered representation of their gallery space’ the former objects which comprised Data_Blood 2.0: A Glitch, a surgical
                        table with the pulsating non-human, side table with surgical supplies, and a hanging television in which the artists’ voices recounted
                        the memories of the pulsating non-human, now play a pink rippling liquid where a glitch now cuts to images of the artists’ eyes.
                        Additional tables have been added with plants as well as open file cabinets, as well as fluorescent pink and red lights in the
                        background walls. Upon clicking on the various objects throughout in the interactive space, a series of restless/rotating messages from
                        the artists’ cyberfeminist manifesto appear. Echoing of Donna Haraway’s 1985 essay “A Cyborg Manifesto,” <sup>5</sup> Morey and Mulenga
                        use the cyborg to reject the boundaries and limitations of the oppressed body imposed by the “antagonistic dualisms” ordered by Western
                        patriarchal/colonial tenets:</p

                        ONE FOOT IN CYBERSPACE<br />
                        ONE FOOT IN THE WILD<br />

                        ><i>Data_Blood III</i> emerges from a grey – liminal space, a borderless experimental zone of in-betweenness where “social roles and
                        relationships are tested and redefined” <sup>6</sup> and provide the potential for transition. This grey virtual space of liminality
                        equally encourages playful deviance from identity categories, such as gender, to be re-signified and to assume a level of agency which
                        has traditionally been frowned-upon in in-real-life patriarchal communities. By abstaining from using any bodies in the liminal space,
                        this helps eliminate the socially constructed signifiers that may influence the mind of visitors with constructed imagery which in turn
                        detracts from imagining. As such, Morey and Mulenga imaginatively take over and subvert the male-dominated technocratic cyberspace and
                        offer a backspace where visitors can join the crusade against patriarchy and explore our secret selves “in an environment of reduced
                        stigma and surveillance.” <sup>7</sup> Ostensibly a clinical and sterile environment, the artists’ swirling manifesto allows for
                        embracing cyberspace while ‘ONE FOOT IN THE WILD’ and prioritizing ‘THE PRIMAL’ and ‘RESIST DOMINATION’ encourages us to embrace
                        deconstructing and reinterpreting social and sexual categories into non-normative identities.<br /><br />

                        The current interregnum is an incredibly challenging context in which we are operating, and this essay may leave the reader with more
                        questions than answers, which is deliberate. In keeping with Morey and Mulenga’s thought-provoking exhibition, the attempt of this essay
                        is to explore new ways of thinking of the world around us. The value of <i>Data_Blood III</i>’s evolution into the virtual sphere
                        transcends beyond the shift in social attention from the human towards machines and data. Given the shock and awe of the pandemic
                        coupled with the disenchantment of culture during the interregnum and the period of accelerated technological change, Morey and Mulenga
                        further extend <i>Data_Blood III</i>’s liminality potential in the virtual sphere to also act as a place for healing.<br /><br />

                        It is during the most tumultuous periods like these that we, as humans tend to fight-or-flight, and we are least able to identify the
                        changes around us, who we want to become, and how to proceed. In the process of trying to avoid discomfort, we fail to notice the
                        potential of liminal places and instead we revert to traditional concepts. The liminal space provides the betwixt and between place
                        necessary between what is familiar and what is still unknown while offering the place that will foster contemplation for meaningful
                        visions of the future.<br />
                        Part of Alice Morey and Emily Mulenga’s legacy as Contemporary Artists through <i>Data_Blood III</i> will (hopefully) be to germinate
                        this habit of seeking fresh ideas in alternative liminal spaces. What is at stake, is the risk of idealizing normalcy.<br /><br />
